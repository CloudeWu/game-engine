Game Engine in python
===================

This is a simple ascii game engine written in python.  
Sorry that I don't have time to give you more information in this README, but you can get the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/CloudeWu/game-engine).  
And I've done my best to document all methods in the core Engine.  
You can also read the example code on [GitHub](https://github.com/CloudeWu/game-engine/blob/main/src/sample-game.py) to grasp a sense of how to use it.  

現在有中文版的說明了！可以到這邊查看：[game-engnine 使用手冊](https://hackmd.io/@Cloude/engine-guide)。  
感謝講師們一起幫忙書寫使用手冊。
