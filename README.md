Game Engine in python
===================

This is a simple ascii game engine written in python.  
Sorry that I don't have time to give you more information, but you can get the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/CloudeWu/game-engine).  
And I've done my best to document all methods in the core Engine.  
You can alse see the example code on GitHub to have a sense of how to use it.
